This is a project that helps to analize the Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations
data obtained with DL_POLY MD sofrwear.
It uses following DL_POLY output files: RDFDAT, REVCON
REVCON is the file of final configuration.
This softwear allows to get bond valences and angles distributions, coordination 
numbers of all atoms, average coordination number.
The investigated system is TeO2 glass. The parameters depend on the system so that
the program cann't be implied to other system without changes.
The program is written during my PhD in University of Limoges, Limoges, France.
